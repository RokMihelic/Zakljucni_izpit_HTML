              <h2>10. Started As A Mod</h2>
               <p>Counter-Strike, like so many things from Valve, originally began as a mod of Half-Life in 1999. Its creators, Minh “Gooseman” Le and Jess Cliffe, were hired by Valve, who also acquired the Counter-Strike IP from them. The period leading up to the full release of Counter-Strike was considered its beta phase, wherein the team tried and removed many different features. Bomb defusal, the game’s most recognizable and popular mode, wasn’t added until beta 4.0.</p>

              <h2>9. An Odd Theme</h2>
               <p>According to Le, co-creator of the original Counter-Strike mod, the game focuses on terrorists and counter-terrorists because, at the time, it was an uncommon theme. In an interview with GameSpot, Minh said “There weren’t a whole lot of games out there that dealt with that theme… I thought it was kind of like a mysterious topic that hadn’t been covered as well.”</p>

              <h2>8. Community Maps</h2>
               <p>All of the original levels for Counter-Strike were made by the community and submitted to co-creator Jess Cliffe to be added into the game. Each version release of the mod would include new maps and neither Le nor Cliffe ever made any of them. Game developers really can’t do that nowadays.</p>

              <h2>7. Team Fortress 2 Inspiration</h2>
               <p>“De_Dust”, one of the most popular maps in Counter-Strike, was inspired by two early-release screenshots of Team Fortress 2. Dave Johnson, the map’s creator, became instantly infatuated with what he saw in those two screenshots. During this infatuation, Johnson, who had just finished making the map “cs_tire”, as approached by Cliffe about making another map for the next version of the game.
                   
               Cliffe assigned Johnson a texture artist, and Johnson sent the screenshots and asked for textures which looked like four specific sections of the pictures. But it didn’t stop there. The level geometry in a couple places, most notably the CT spawn, was also ripped almost 1:1 from the TF2 screenshot.</p>

              <h2>6. Map As Old As Time</h2>
               <p>“CS_Siege” is one of the oldest maps in the game, having first been implemented in Beta 1.0. More notably, it’s the only map from that time that’s still in the game to this very day, granted it has been changed a bit for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. EVEN MORE notably, if you can believe it, “cs_siege” began as a map called “Canyon Hunt”. The map’s creator, noth1ng, submitted “Canyon Hunt” in a PC Gamer competition to design a map for Team Fortress Classic, and it won.</p>

              <h2>5. Jeepathon2k</h2>
               <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was never considered to be Counter-Strike 2. Instead, CS: GO was designed as a marriage of Counter-Strike 1.6 and CS: Source, all brought into the modern day with online functions considered standard in today’s shooters. According to Valve, this was done because, despite their expectations, when CS: Source came out, not everyone left CS 1.6, so the community was divided. Though, interestingly enough, plenty of people still play both CS 1.6 and CS: Source. Guess you can’t please everyone.</p>

               <p>“CS_Siege” is one of the oldest maps in the game, having first been implemented in Beta 1.0. More notably, it’s the only map from that time that’s still in the game to this very day, granted it has been changed a bit for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

              <h2>3. AWP Still OP</h2>
               <p>The AWP is, even in CS:GO, considered one of the most powerful weapons in Counter-Strike history, and is easily the most used. Prior to Counter-Strike 1.1, shooting any single body part of an enemy with the AWP was an instant kill. The idea was that the time it took to reload the AWP would offset its power, but this was not the case.

               1.1 made leg shots non-lethal. 1.5 made it take longer to switch to the AWP and made hip-fire extremely inaccurate. 1.6 drastically increased scope-in time. And it still isn’t nerfed enough.</p>

              <h2>2. VAC And Custom Servers</h2>
               <p>Valve’s ubiquitous anti-cheating software, called Valve Anti-Cheat, or VAC, was implemented in 2002 with Counter-Strike. Cheating and hacking were rampant in Counter-Strike prior to VAC due to the game’s origin. At the start, many of its players were from the mod community, or were interested in it. Changes to the game could be made through custom servers, a process which remains prevalent in server-based games to this day.</p>

              <h2>1. The Worst Counter-Strike Mode Ever</h2>
               <p>In Counter-Strike 1.6 there was a mode called Assassination. In this mode, a single player was the VIP and it was their job to reach the escape zone for the counter-terrorists to win. If they died, the terrorists win. This mode was only featured on the map “Oilrig”, and it’s considered the least popular map and mode in the game. Although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero features the mode, no new maps were made for it, and evidence suggests it was to be included in Counter-Strike: Source, but was cut during development.</p>
